# Mixin
The mixin plugin is basically the most important one as it resolves custom properties such as *platform queries*, *stateful conditions* and much more.<br>
While plugins modify the whole style object, mixins are especially used to resolve single properties.

## Available mixins
Check out [Mixins.md](../Mixins.md) which provides a complete and detailed list of all build-in mixins that are available.
